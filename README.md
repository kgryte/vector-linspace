linspace
========

DEPRECATED: use [compute-linspace](https://github.com/compute-io/linspace).

Create a vector of linearly spaced numbers.


## Installation

``` bash
$ npm install vector-linspace
```


## Examples

``` javascript
var linspace = require( 'vector-linspace' );

var vector = linspace( 0, 1, 21 );
```

## Tests

Unit tests use the [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha) test framework with [Chai](http://chaijs.com) assertions.

Assuming you have installed Mocha, execute the following command in the top-level application directory to run the tests:

``` bash
$ mocha
```

All new feature development should have corresponding unit tests to validate correct functionality.
